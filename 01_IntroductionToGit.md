## Introduction to Git

   **GIT**- The world's most popular version control system.

   **Version Control**

     * Version control is software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.

     * Version control systems generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more.

     * Git is just one of the many version control systems available today. Other well-known ones include Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial.
