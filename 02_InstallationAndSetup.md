###### **GIT**

- Git was created as command-line tool. 
- To use it, we run various git commands in a Unix shell. This is not the most user friendly experience, but it's at the very core of Git!

###### **GIT GUI**

- companies have created graphical user interfaces for Git that allow people to use Git without having to be a command-line expert.
- Few Examples include:-
  - Github Desktop
  - SourceTree
  - Tower
  - GitKraken
  - Ungit

###### **GIT GUI/Clients**

  - **PROS**
    - Way lower barrier-of-entry for beginners compared to the command-line.
    - Friendlier to use. Can be a much better experience (when it works)
    - Some people prefer the visual experience, even those who can use the command-line.
    
  - **Cons**
    - At times, there is lots of "magic" involved. The inner-workings of Git are obfuscated and hidden away with GUI's.
    - Often leads to dependance on a particular piece of software.
    - When things go seriously wrong, it can be very challenging to fix without the command-line
    - The interfaces, buttons, and menus vary between different GUI's.

###### **GIT Command Line**

  - **PROS**
    - Git is a command-line tool. All the documentation and resources online will refer to the command-line
    - The command-line can be way faster once you get comfortable with it! 
    - Some of the more advanced Git features are only available on the command-line
    - The commands are always the same, no matter what machine you are on!
    
  - **Cons**
    - Not beginner-friendly. At All. Can be difficult to learn and remember the commands at first.
    - Even for some practiced users, the commandline interface is just not a good experience. It's really a matter of preference.


###### **Configuring Git**
  To configure the name that Git will associate with your work, run this command:

    ``` git config --global user.‚ùØ name "Tom Hulce" ```
