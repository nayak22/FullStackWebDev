###### GIT

- Git was created as command-line tool. 
- To use it, we run various git commands in a Unix shell. This is not the most user friendly experience, but it's at the very core of Git!

###### GIT GUI

-companies have created graphical user interfaces for Git that allow people to use Git without having to be a command-line expert.
- Few Examples include:-
  - Github Desktop
  - SourceTree
  - Tower
  - GitKraken
  - Ungit
