# Learning GIT and GIT Hub BootCamp

## Introduction to Git

   
**GIT**- The world's most popular version control system.

**Version Control**

     * Version control is software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.

     * Version control systems generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, 
       compare changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more.

     * Git is just one of the many version control systems available today. 
       Other well-known ones include Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial.
     
**Why Git is used?**

     1. Track changes across multiple files.

     2. Compare versions of a project.

     3. "Time travel" back to old versions.

     4. Revert to a previous version

     5. Collaborate and share changes.

     6. Combine changes

**Git Users**

   **Tech-Adjacent Roles**
        
                Many people in non-developer roles end up learning the
                basics of Git to collaborate with their coworkers. Designers in
                particular often need to work with Git.
   **Governments**
        
                In recent years, governments have started using Git to manage
                the drafting of laws. Washington DC City council uses Git &
                Github to publish its laws. Citizens have even found and fixed
                typos collaboratively using Git
                
   **Scientists**
   
                Git is commonly used by research teams at universities and
                agencies around the world to manage code, data sets, and more.
                Git + Github is especially powerful in the peer-reviewed world of
                science and research.
                
   **Writers**
   
                Some writers love using Git to manage drafts of complex
                novels, screenplays, or other works with lots of moving parts
                and constant changes across multiple files.
                In particular, Git is gaining popularity for use in collaborative
                textbook writing with multiple authors.

      Git is the version control software that runs locally on
      your machine. You don't need to register for an account.
      You don't need the internet to use it. You can use Git
      without ever touching Github.

      Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud
      and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.
      You do need to sign up for an account to use Github. It's
      an online place to share work that is done using Git.
